    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <img src="/Users/Rojin/Desktop/untitled folder 10\IMG_5796.jpg">
    
    <p>I was born in Tehran, Iran and moved to the states at the age of five. I can speak Farsi and English fluently, and French on a conversational level. Growing up, I was very interested in art- wether it was design, painting, sketching, photography, music, etc. I also taught myself how to play the piano and guitar. My hobbies include traveling, movies, music, outdoor activities, and being around family and friends.  </p>
