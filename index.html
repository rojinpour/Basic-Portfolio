                Hello, I'm Rojin Pourkhomami and I am currently studying Full-Stack Web Development at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte.
		
			<p>
                I was born in Tehran, Iran and moved to the States at the age of five. My native language is Farsi and secondary is English. I can also speak French on a conversational level as I am still continuing to learn. 
			</p>
			<p>
                Growing up, I found great interest in the arts (movies, music, painting, photography, etc.) I taught myself how to play the piano in elementary school and guitar in middle school. I love the outdoors and try to travel as much as I can in my spare time.
